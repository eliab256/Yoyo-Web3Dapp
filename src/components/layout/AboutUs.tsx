                            YoYo is an inclusive yoga platform created from a personal journey — inspired by the
                            founder's sister, who faced permanent mobility challenges after an accident. What began as a
                            search for accessible movement has grown into a mission to make yoga truly available to
                            everyone. With the help of yoga teachers, physiotherapists, and wellness experts, YoYo
                            offers personalized programs tailored to each user's physical needs. Whether you're a
                            beginner, pregnant, using prosthetics, or dealing with mobility issues, YoYo adapts to you.

                        To push the experience further, YoYo integrates NFT technology, allowing users to unlock
                        exclusive content, redeem rewards, and join themed events, making the practice of yoga more
                        connected, inclusive, and future-ready. Both the auctions and the NFTs of Yoyo are managed by
                        Solidity smart contracts deployed on the Ethereum Sepolia testnet. All functions have been
                        tested to allow each user to place bids, win, and transfer their own NFTs. The web interface
                        enables users to interact with the contracts easily and in a user-friendly way, while
                        maintaining the level of security guaranteed by the blockchain.
