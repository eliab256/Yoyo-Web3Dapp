/**
 * Custom hook to claim failed Ether refunds for users who experienced refund transaction failures.
 *
 * @remarks
 * This hook provides functionality to recover Ether when the automatic refund process fails
 * after losing an auction bid. It implements a comprehensive solution that:
 *
 * **Detection of Failed Refunds**: Queries the indexer database to identify refund transactions
 * that failed for the connected wallet address. This is done by cross-referencing successful
 * refunds with failed refund events to determine if there are any unclaimed amounts.
 *
 * **Smart Contract Interaction**: Calls the `claimFailedRefunds` function on the YoyoAuction
 * contract. This function verifies the user's eligibility and transfers the owed Ether back
 * to the user's wallet on-chain. Unlike `claimNftForWinner`, this function doesn't require
 * any arguments as it processes all failed refunds for the caller.
 *
 * **Real-time Validation**: The hook continuously monitors for unclaimed refunds through
 * a query that refetches when the window regains focus, ensuring the UI always reflects
 * the current refund status without requiring manual refreshes.
 *
 * @used-in
 * - `ClaimFailedRefundButton.tsx` - Renders the claim refund button with transaction states
 *
 * @returns Object containing claim function, transaction states, and unclaimed refund status
 * @returns {() => void} claimRefund - Function to execute the refund claim transaction on the blockchain
 * @returns {boolean} isWritePending - True while the transaction is being signed/submitted
 * @returns {boolean} isConfirming - True while waiting for transaction confirmation on-chain
 * @returns {boolean} isConfirmed - True once the transaction has been successfully confirmed
 * @returns {string | undefined} hash - Transaction hash, available after submission
 * @returns {Error | null} error - Error object from either write or confirmation failures
 * @returns {boolean | undefined} hasUnclaimedRefund - True if the user has failed refunds to claim, false otherwise
